## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Kodziak, but you can call me [Przemek](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ppaczoski/)! 

I'm a QA guy who can undertake complex problems and produce final solutions. I'm fascinated about making better work processes using agile methodologies and iterate over written solutions to gain better results.
